                        How is New Horizon organized?
                        Posted by Gerry Callaghan on 2018-02-04
                        We have a pretty standard voluntary organisation structure of chair, secretary and treasurer.
                        These are elected at an AGM each year. We plan on holding a committee meeting once a month to
                        plan and coordinate activities. Each Wednesday we hold a drop-in clinic on the Direct Provision
                        site. This deals with health, education, housing and family support issues. Volunteers tend to
                        create their own roles taking into account their previous skills and experiences. These may not
                        correspond too well with the official structure but do definitely work.</li>

                        What is New Horizon’s Mission Statement?

                        The New Horizon constitution says:
                    <li>
                        To Welcome and support people who seek refuge in our midst
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To Give information and support as necessary
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To Celebrate the riches the newcomers bring to this society
                    </li>
                    </li>

                        Who Funds New Horizon?

                        It is funded by small scale grants from Westmeath Community Development Ltd.
                        Individual projects are funded from various sources such as the Health Service Executive (HSE)
                        and St. Stephen’s Green Trust.
