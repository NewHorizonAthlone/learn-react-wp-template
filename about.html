                        How is New Horizon organized?

                        We have a pretty standard voluntary organisation structure of chair, secretary and treasurer.
                        These are elected at an AGM each year. We plan on holding a committee meeting once a month to
                        plan and coordinate activities. Each Wednesday we hold a drop-in clinic on the Direct Provision
                        site. This deals with health, education, housing and family support issues. Volunteers tend to
                        create their own roles taking into account their previous skills and experiences. These may not
                        correspond too well with the official structure but do definitely work.</li>
