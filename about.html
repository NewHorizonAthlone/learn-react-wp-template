                        We have a pretty standard voluntary organisation structure of chair, secretary and treasurer.
                        These are elected at an AGM each year. We plan on holding a committee meeting once a month to
                        plan and coordinate activities. Each Wednesday we hold a drop-in clinic on the Direct Provision
                        site. This deals with health, education, housing and family support issues. Volunteers tend to
                        create their own roles taking into account their previous skills and experiences. These may not
                        correspond too well with the official structure but do definitely work.

                        It is funded by small scale grants from Westmeath Community Development Ltd.
                        Individual projects are funded from various sources such as the Health Service Executive (HSE)
                        and St. Stephen’s Green Trust.

                        New Horizon is not in the business of selling, renting or trading email lists with companies and
                        businesses for marketing purposes.
                        We are not a government-supported organisation and maintain strict confidentiality in all our
                        dealings with refugees, asylum seekers, volunteers and other support groups.
                        We do need some information to be able to do our support work. Our Privacy Policy provides lots
                        of

                        limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure.
